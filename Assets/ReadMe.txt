Summary:
Our game is a Cooperative 2D-Action scroller in which two players fly through various terrain and work together to destroy invanders. 
Players can fuse their ships together to form a stronger and better machine of war. Players will have to communicate and work together to
beat the game.

Player Experience:
We want players to feel excitement and amusement while they squadrons of enemies fighter together. Furthermore because its a cooperative game, 
we want players to form a connection with their teammate and interact with them.
